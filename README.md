# ng-three-template

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and is designed as a basic
template for [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) combined with [Angular](https://angular.io/)
and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) in Version 4.x

The project is setup to use global [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) only
and [ViewEncapsulation.None](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewEncapsulation).

Feel free to do anything you want with this template.

use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

for a production build.

## Running unit tests
